# Mancala-neat
A mancala AI trained using the [NEAT-Python library](https://neat-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

As a guide, I will be using this YouTube [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzMcBGfZo4-lwGZWXz5Qgta_YNX3_vLS2), which follows Tech By Tim as he trains an AI to play Flappy Bird.

Although this mancala AI is not capable of looking or planning ahead, I want to see how a NEAT based AI performs against more suitable searching algorithms.

And of course, as a new mancala player, I am excited to see what interesting moves will arise from the power of evolution.
